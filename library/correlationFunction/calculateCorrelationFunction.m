% EXPLANATIONS OF CALCULATION:
% IFFt is slower than FFT, because FFT has a build in function which
% detects whether the input data is real or complex and therefore chooses
% an optimized way to calculate the inverse FT. Because the input data of
% IFFT is real, this data can be seen as conjugate symmetric. Therefore,
% the 'symmetric' flag at IFFT is set.
% The reason why in frequency domain the squared real and imaginary part
% are summed is, because the autocorrelation require the "convolution" (not
% directly the convolution, but more the correlation) of a signal and its 
% complex conjugate. This is a multiplication of the signal
% and its complex conjugate in frequency domain and therefore the real and
% imaginary part summed up.

% fft creates a vector with higher amplitudes => to get a valid result from
% fft you have to devide by the length of the vector
% ifft reduces to the original amplitudes i.e. fft(x) = higher amplitudes ,
% ifft(fft(x)) = original amplitudes => with ifft(fft(x) *fft(y)) you need
% to devide by the length but only once
