The constants are given in constants.txt and the configuration is given in config.conf.
For the constants the following units and explanations are given:

hbar 			= [Js] 
gammaRad		= [rad/Ts] gyromagnetic relation
B0 			= [T] main magnetic field
mu0			= [N/A^2] Vacuum permeability 4*pi*1e-7
Nm			= [m] Nanometer (Trajectory format)
DD 			= [J/rad] Dipol-Dipol ineraction constants (Calculated in Script)
omega0			= [rad/s] Larmor (anglular) frequency (Calculated in Script)

The config file contains information about paths and computations. The names should be self
explaining.
